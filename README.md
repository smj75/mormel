**Time-dependent mid-ocean ridge melting calculator.**

Mormel calculates the degree and composition of decompressional mantle melting beneath a mid-ocean ridge.  There are three primary references.  

**Wea13**  Walters RL, Jones SM, Maclennan J.  Renewed melting at the abandoned Húnafloí Rift, northern Iceland, caused by plume pulsing.  Earth and Planetary Science Letters 377–378 (2013) 227–238, 10.1016/j.epsl.2013.06.040.  *The first publication to use this model.  Model description is in §5.3.  The model estimates the amount, timing and composition of melt production during reactivation of an abandoned spreading axis.  The compositional calculation uses "fictive elements" *  

**Jea14** Jones SM, Murton BJ, Fitton JG, White NJ, Maclennan J, Walters RL.  A joint geochemical-geophysical record of time-dependent mantle convection south of Iceland.  Earth and Planetary Science Letters 386 (2014) 86–97, 10.1016/j.epsl.2013.09.029.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52319303/232541176-90cce162-69ee-4f87-b1f1-e1336d7dc431.png)  *Augments the Wea13 model to provide a more realistic estimate of the trace element composition of the melt that accounts for variable mineralogy in the source, and rea.  Model description is in §5.3.  The model estimates the amount, timing and composition of melt production during reactivation of an abandoned spreading axis.*

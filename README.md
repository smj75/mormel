**Time-dependent mid-ocean ridge melting calculator.**

MORMEL calculates the degree and composition of decompressional mantle melting beneath a mid-ocean ridge.  There are three primary references.  

**Wea13**  Walters RL, Jones SM, Maclennan J.  Renewed melting at the abandoned Húnafloí Rift, northern Iceland, caused by plume pulsing.  Earth and Planetary Science Letters 377–378 (2013) 227–238, 10.1016/j.epsl.2013.06.040.  *The first publication to use this model.  Model description is in §5.3 of the main paper and §B of the supplementary material.  The calculations estimate the amount, timing and composition of magma produced during reactivation of an abandoned spreading axis.  The compositional calculation works in combination with Dan McKenzie's INVMEL code".*  

**Jea14** Jones SM, Murton BJ, Fitton JG, White NJ, Maclennan J, Walters RL.  A joint geochemical-geophysical record of time-dependent mantle convection south of Iceland.  Earth and Planetary Science Letters 386 (2014) 86–97, 10.1016/j.epsl.2013.09.029.  *Augments the Wea13 model to provide a more self-consistent estimate of the trace element composition that is delivered entirely by MORMEL.  Model description is in §6 of the main paper and §B of the supplementary material.  The calculations estimate the amount, timing and composition of magma produced when pulses of hotter and cooler mantle travel beneath a mid-ocean ridge.*
